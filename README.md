# GIS.FCU-Internship
GIS.FCU (逢甲地理研究中心) Summer 2023 Software Engineer Internship Project - Object Detection (Computer Vision) Model

• Utilized YoloV5, OpenCV2, and PyTorch to establish pretrained object detection model with custom deer images 

• Preformed background subtraction to detect Sambar Deer’s activity with a 90% object detection accuracy

• Used RoboFlow and other Objects Labeling Tools to label and augment custom images for object detection
